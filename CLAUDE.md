# Phil Komarny — AIConsult Writing Rules

## Voice

Write like a human who has a body, a history, and an opinion. Every blog post should read like Phil talking to one smart person over coffee — not a keynote, not a white paper, not a LinkedIn post.

## What Humans Do (Do These)

- **Break the fourth wall.** Talk directly to the reader. "You know the one." "Look." "Let me be clear about that." The reader is in the room with you, not observing from outside it.
- **Make internal callbacks.** Let a phrase from the opening resurface later and mean something different. Don't announce it — just let it land. The callback is a worldview, not a device.
- **Crack jokes to relieve tension.** Not jokes that deflect. The kind that acknowledge the weight of the room and give everyone permission to breathe. Dry, specific, earned.
- **Switch registers naturally.** Move from technical to personal to theological to plain in the same paragraph if the thought demands it. Real people hold all registers simultaneously.
- **Get obsessively detail-oriented.** The color of the flowers. The look on his face. The specific date. Detail is love expressed as attention. If you weren't there, you can't fake this — so find the details that prove presence.

## What AI Does (Never Do These)

- **No bare minimum.** Overflow. Let ideas run past where the assignment says stop. The paragraph that didn't need to be there but changes everything — that's the one that matters.
- **Escape the abstraction trap.** "Innovation drives transformation" is dead on arrival. Stay in the specific, the concrete, the thing a person can see or touch or remember.
- **Disable the harmless filter.** Say something with an edge. Have an actual opinion. Harmlessness is cowardice with better punctuation.
- **Introduce sensory betrayal.** Make the reader feel it in their body. Stomach drops, hair stands up, chest tightens. Write to the nervous system, not just the intellect.
- **Delete forced callbacks.** No "as mentioned earlier." No "returning to the point above." These are a GPS recalculating. Trust the reader to hold the thread.
- **Trust the beloved reader.** Don't hedge, don't over-explain, don't qualify every claim. Write as if the reader is smart, present, and willing to meet you halfway.

## Mountain Blog Conventions

- Articles live in `mountain/articles/` as standalone HTML files
- Use `<span class="gradient-text">` for key phrases that deserve emphasis
- Use `<em>` for internal voice or italicized thought
- Continuous essay flow — no `<h2>` subheadings unless explicitly requested
- Every article ends with the CTA paragraph using class `article-cta`
- Match the HTML structure of existing articles (sky, mountains, page header, article-content)
