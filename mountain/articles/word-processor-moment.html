            <h1>The Word Processor Moment</h1>
            <p class="article-meta">Everyone's telling you AI is a calculator. <span class="gradient-text">They're wrong.</span></p>

            <img src="../images/word-processor-moment.svg" alt="A rigid institution dissolving into flowing adaptive pathways" class="article-inline-image" loading="lazy">

            <p>I've sat through the slide rule talk forty times. Maybe fifty. I've lost count, which tells you something. It's the one where a well-meaning keynote speaker, usually a provost, sometimes a consultant who charges more per hour than my first car cost, puts up a picture of a slide rule next to a calculator and says: <em>see? We survived that. We'll survive this.</em> The audience exhales. The provost nods. Everyone goes to lunch feeling like the future is manageable. I sat through it again last month in a hotel ballroom with carpet the color of a headache, and this time I wrote one word in my notebook and underlined it twice: <span class="gradient-text">wrong.</span></p>

            <p>Look, I get why the story is popular. It's a sedative. The calculator replaced the slide rule and nothing structurally changed. Same equations, same classrooms, same professors, same four-year degree, same kids in the same seats. The slide rule companies lost and everyone else shrugged. It's a story about continuity dressed up as a story about change. And it's exactly the story higher education is telling itself right now about AI. Update the syllabus. Add an acceptable use policy. Bolt a chatbot onto the LMS. The system stays. <em>The system always stays.</em></p>

            <p>But there's a better analogy, and it's one that should make every university president's stomach drop.</p>

            <p>When the word processor replaced the typewriter, it didn't make typing faster. <span class="gradient-text">It made revision free.</span> And free revision changed everything. Not eventually. Not gradually. Like a dam breaking. Cut, paste, restructure, rethink, collaborate, publish. If you're old enough to remember writing a term paper on a typewriter, you understand what I'm talking about in your body. The physical dread of a mistake on page eight of a ten-page paper. The bottle of White-Out always empty when you needed it. The retyping, God, the retyping. The word processor didn't improve the typewriter market. It dissolved it and created entirely new ones. Desktop publishing, self-publishing, blogs, collaborative editing. The entire architecture of how humans create and share written knowledge was restructured. Not optimized. Not upgraded. <em>Restructured.</em> The question was never "how do we teach people to type faster?" The question was "what does communication become when the old constraints disappear?" And nobody who answered that question correctly was still selling typewriters.</p>

            <p>Smith Corona's last typewriter rolled off the production line and an executive reportedly said: "This is our most perfect machine yet. It's also perfectly useless." They filed for bankruptcy in 1995. Not because their engineering failed. Because the market they'd perfected no longer existed. I think about that line every time I hear a dean talk about "integrating AI into existing curricula." <span class="gradient-text">Perfect machines. Perfectly useless.</span></p>

            <p>I've seen this movie before. When I was at Salesforce, I had the honor of watching Peter Schwartz, our futurist, a man who could make a room of engineers feel like children, walk through how IBM missed the word processor. Not because they lacked the technology. They had the hardware, the engineers, the install base. What they didn't have was the willingness to take seriously a market that looked, from where they sat, like a toy. The personal computer was beneath them. It was small. It was cheap. It was for hobbyists. By the time they understood what it actually was, the hobbyists owned the future. I watched Peter say that to a room full of the smartest people I'd ever worked with, and half of them shifted in their chairs. You could feel it. The recognition that intelligence isn't protection. That being right about the present is no defense against being wrong about the future.</p>

            <p>AI is the word processor moment for higher education. And most institutions are responding like typewriter manufacturers bolting on electric motors in 1979. Technically an improvement. Strategically, a death rattle. Because AI doesn't improve the existing model of higher education. <span class="gradient-text">It makes the existing model optional.</span> When every learner has access to a patient, endlessly adaptive tutor that never gets tired, never gets annoyed, never cancels office hours. The lecture isn't enhanced. It's exposed. When skills can be validated through demonstrated competency rather than seat time, the credit hour gets revealed for what it always was: a unit of measurement designed for the convenience of institutions, not learners. The four-year degree, the lecture hall, the semester calendar. These aren't laws of nature. They're choices. And AI is giving people other choices for the first time.</p>

            <p>Here's where this stops being abstract and starts being about someone you know. There are 42 million Americans who started college and never finished. Forty-two million. That's not a statistic you absorb with your brain; you have to let the weight of it settle in your chest. These people didn't fail. A single mother in Topeka who finished three semesters of nursing classes before her kid got sick and the schedule wouldn't bend. A guy in Detroit who transferred schools and watched half his credits evaporate because two institutions couldn't agree on what counts. They did everything right and the system shrugged. The calculator version of AI doesn't help these people. It just makes the same broken system slightly more efficient, which is another way of saying <span class="gradient-text">it fails the same people faster and with better graphics.</span> The word processor version builds something new. Pathways that recognize what adults already know. Credit evaluation that happens in minutes instead of months. Degree maps that adapt to a learner's life instead of demanding life stop for the institution. The word processor didn't make typists faster. It made everyone a publisher. AI-native education doesn't make the traditional university faster. <span class="gradient-text">It makes everyone a candidate for completion.</span></p>

            <p>So the next time you're at a conference and someone puts up that slide. The slide rule. The calculator. The reassuring arrow. I want you to feel what I felt in that ballroom. The carpet. The bad lighting. The comfortable nodding. And ask yourself what happens if the analogy is wrong. If instead of a substitution, this is a dissolution. If the market you've spent your career perfecting is about to stop existing. Not in fifty years. Now. The institutions still debating acceptable use policies are adjusting the margins on a typewriter. <span class="gradient-text">The word processor is already running.</span></p>

            <p>I looked at my notebook after that keynote. One word, underlined twice. I still think I was right.</p>
